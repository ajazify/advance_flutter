<h1> How to create an App with Hive Database</h1>
<h3>#Hive #Flutter #LocalDataBase</h3>

<p>Let's Learn how to create a FLutter app Hive Local Database</p>

<h3>What is hive?</h3>
<p>Hive is a lightweight and fast key-value database written in pure Dart, designed specifically for Flutter and Dart applications. It is an alternative to SQLite for Flutter apps that need to store data locally on the device. Hive is particularly popular due to its simplicity, high performance, and ease of use.</p>

<h2>Key Features of Hive</h2>
<h3>No Native Dependencies</h3>
<p>Hive is written entirely in Dart and does not require any native dependencies, making it easy to set up and use across different platforms.</p>

<h3>Fast Performance</h3>
<p>Hive is optimized for performance and claims to be faster than other local databases like SQLite or shared preferences.</p>

<h3>Simple API</h3>
<p>Hive provides a simple and intuitive API for storing and retrieving data, making it easy to integrate into Flutter applications.</p>

<h3>Strongly Typed</h3>
<p>Hive supports strong typing, allowing developers to define data structures using Dart classes and annotations.</p>

<h3>Box System</h3>
<p>Hive uses a box system to store data. A box is a collection of key-value pairs and is similar to a table in a traditional database.
</p>

<h3>Automatic Type Adapters</h3>
<p>Hive can automatically generate type adapters for custom Dart objects, making it easy to store and retrieve complex data types.</p>

<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>Hive supports data encryption, allowing sensitive data to be securely stored on the device.</p>

<h3>Reactive Programming</h3>
<p>Hive provides reactive listeners to watch changes in the data, allowing for easy UI updates when the data changes.</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

dependencies:
  hive: ^[version]
  hive_flutter: ^[version]

dev_dependencies:
hive_generator: ^[version]
build_runner: ^[version]
